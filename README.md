I made a sketch of the a2c neural network.
There are probably errors in the code, it is possible that I did everything wrong because I am not an expert in this.

a2c is a neural network that relates to reinforcement learning. Where 2 networks are used 1)Actor 2)Critic

thanks a lot to HannulaTero for his project https://github.com/HannulaTero/Building-Neural-Network-with-GMS2-

The agent must find rooms with a reward. At first, he will walk randomly, and then he will find the optimal path.

(The reward is highlighted in red)

space bar - Acceleration

1 - show the critic network score

R - restart the room
