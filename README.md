I made a sketch of the a2c neural network.
There are probably bugs in the code, since I'm not an expert in this.

a2c is a neural network that relates to reinforcement learning. Where 2 networks are used 1)Actor 2)Critic

thanks a lot to HannulaTero for his project https://github.com/HannulaTero/Building-Neural-Network-with-GMS2-

The essence of the project
The agent must find rooms with a reward
