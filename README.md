I made a sketch of the PPO neural network.
There are probably errors in the code, it is possible that I did everything wrong because I am not an expert in this.
I used the chatGPT4o neural network for help.

PPO is a neural network that relates to reinforcement learning. Where 2 networks are used 1)Policy 2)Value

thanks a lot to HannulaTero for his project https://github.com/HannulaTero/Building-Neural-Network-with-GMS2-
(much is taken from this project)

An agent (circle) has to get to a target (square). At first it will walk randomly, and then it will find the optimal path.
